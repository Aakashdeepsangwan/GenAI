    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes simplicity, 
    readability, and versatility. Developed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991,
    Python has become one of the most popular languages in the world. It uses clear and 
    easy-to-understand syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners while still being powerful 
    enough for professionals.

    Python supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional 
    programming. It comes with a vast standard library and numerous third-party modules that allow developers 
    to perform a wide range of tasks — from web and software development to data analysis, machine learning, 
    and automation.

    Its cross-platform compatibility, active community, and ease of integration with other languages make 
    Python ideal for modern computing applications and rapid prototyping.
